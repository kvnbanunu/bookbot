# bookbot

BookBot is my first boot.dev project!

The program takes in a book/.txt file and returns the amount of words found, and the occurrences of alphabet characters sorted from highest to lowest.

## Usage

You need to provide a txt file and include the relative path in main.py
Then run `python3 main.py`
